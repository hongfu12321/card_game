# Two-Player Card Game Simulation

## Overview

This project is a Python simulation of a simple two-player card game. The game is designed to be fully automated, where the players don't make any decisionsâ€”the game runs entirely based on the rules provided. The goal is to simulate a game where two players compete by drawing cards from their respective decks, and the player with the higher-valued card wins that round. The game continues until all cards have been played, and the player with the most points wins.

## How the Game Works

1. **Deck of Cards**: The game begins with a standard deck of 52 cards, consisting of 4 suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs) and 13 ranks (1 through 13).

2. **Dealing Cards**: The deck is shuffled and then evenly distributed between the two players.

3. **Playing the Game**:
   - Each player draws the top card from their deck.
   - The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and scores points equivalent to the number of cards in play (1 point per card).
   - If the ranks are the same, the suit is used as a tiebreaker, with the order from highest to lowest being Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs.
   - The game continues until both players have no cards left in their decks.

4. **Winning the Game**: The player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the game is declared a draw.

## Project Structure

- `Card`: A class representing a single card in the deck, with a suit and rank. Includes methods for comparison (`<`, `==`).
- `Deck`: A class that initializes a full deck of 52 cards, shuffles them, and distributes them between the players.
- `Player`: A class representing a player in the game. Each player has a name, a deck of cards, a score, and a history of the cards they've played.
- `Game`: The main class that handles the game logic, including dealing cards, running rounds, and determining the winner.
